# Rebaze Homebrew Repository (Tap)

This tap contains formulae that might help MacOS based Java Developers happier.

## How do I install these formulae?

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install rebaze/repo/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebaze/homebrew-repo/master/<formula>.rb
```
